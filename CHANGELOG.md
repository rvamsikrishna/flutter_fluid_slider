## [0.0.1] - 28th october 2018.

A fluid design slider that works just like the [Slider] material widget.

Used to select from a range of values.

The fluid slider will be disabled if [onChanged] is null.

By default, a fluid slider will be as wide as possible, with a height of 60.0. When
given unbounded constraints, it will attempt to make itself 200.0 wide.
